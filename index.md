# Goal of the Game

In Block Jump, your goal is to accumulate the highest score by jumping over as many moving stalagmites as possible. 

# Project Goal

We were inspired by platformer games and the artstyles of Ori Will of the Wisps and Hollow Knight. We wanted to create a game that was simple to play and incorporated pretty visuals.

# Game Overview

Block Jump begins with the main character, a red block, on the left side of the screen. The player is prompted to begin the game by hitting the space bar. Once the game begins, stalagmites start moving right to left towards the player. To avoid the stalagmites, the player uses either the spacebar or the up arrow key to jump. For every 1000 points, the speed of the obstacles will increase by one frame per second. The game ends when the character collides with one of the stalagmites.

When the game ends, the highest score a player has gotten playing the game will be displayed. This stat is updated for every new game play and will be overwritten if the current player's score is greater than the previous player's score.

# Character

The main character of Block Jump is this red rectangle. The spacebar or the up arrow key can be pressed to get the player to jump.

# Obstacles

The obstacles of Block Jump are stalagmites, which move along the floor of the cave. The distance between the stalagmites is randomized to the timing of when a player will need to jump is unpredictable.
